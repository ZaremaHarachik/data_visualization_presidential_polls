Data Visualization – 2016 Presidential Polls – Built visualizations to analyze polling data for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The project involved importing, cleaning, and preparing the data, then creating charts to compare candidate performance and show trends over time. Through this project, I learned how to work with raw data using Python and pandas, create meaningful visualizations with matplotlib, interpret insights from data, and present them clearly. Charts include polling trends over time and candidate comparison, with captions explaining what each shows. While the visualizations are static, this project helped me understand data analysis fundamentals and plan future improvements such as interactive charts or real-time analysis.
